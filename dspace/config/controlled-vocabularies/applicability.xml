    <hasNote>To what extent is the innovation/ development transferable (to other sectors, regions, user groups etc.)?  Whether and how must structures and framework conditions be changed to allow a diffusion of the innovation/development? Which supporting structures and framework conditions already exist that promote the establishment / transfer / spread of the innovation/ development?  Are there financing possibilities to support a broader establishment? Does the innovation/development touch on conflicting interests that threaten its establishment?</hasNote>
