  - revise ruler option in numerous templates (see 2023-05-22) -> ruler is put first instead of last
  - add duration to period template
  - add ruler below project partner to have a consistent approach
  - consistently rename "key" to "label" to avoid confusion with "key-value"
section 4.3.2
  - change label "Art der Rahmenbedingung" to "Transformationsbereich" and
  "Hauptelement" to "Kernelement" based on Birge's mail from May 22nd
section 3.1.2
  - remove table in favour of the block approach
  - correct CERIF template for responsible organisation

2023-06-03
general
  - add more translation constructs to the CERIF template, like <FieldOfActivity>@virtual.vocabulary_i18n.dc-type@</FieldOfActivity>
  - add new templates for blocks in a table cell to reduce code and improve consistency
    - value-single-table
    - value-comma-list-table
    - value-nace-destatis-table
    - value-icon-count-table
  - introduce a new parameter (margin.top.label-below) to control the margin between label and values display in the row below  
section 5.1
  - create new table that merges different partners 
section 3.2
  - use new table cell templates 
section 3.1.6
  - use new table cell templates  
section 4.1
  - use new table cell templates
section 5.2 & 5.3
  - add "value-with-info" template
  - adjust section so that the information used in section 5.1 is not longer used      
section 3.1.4
  - start completely new template for publications
  - integrate new template "value-issue-date-author-table" to provide publication date and authors in one line

2023-06-04
general
  - add translations for all section titles and the page (used for page numner)
section 3.1.4
  - integrate new template "value-issue-date-author-table" to provide publication date and authors in one line
  - integrate new template "value-publication-information-table" to provide a bunch of publcation informations
section 3.1.5
  - create completely new template for products
  - adjust template "label-value-line-list" (now called "label-value-line-list-below") so that it behaves the same way as "label-value-single-below" and "label-value-comma-list-below", here used to list the reference publications
section 3.1.3
  - start to rewrite completely this section
  - since this section covers 5 entities there is a main template for this section referring to 5 templates, each dedicated to one of the relevant entities

2023-06-07
general
  - add new template "empty-table-cell-catcher" 
section 3.1.3
  - integrate two new templates that show a label and below the corresponding value, this time in a table 
    - "label-value-single-below-table"
    - "label-value-comma-list-below-table"
    - "label-period-below-table"
    - "label-postcode-below-table"
    - NOTE: While working on these new templates it became apparent that when no label-value pair is availabe there is trouble. The initial approach was to catch this with an if clause for the value in "label-value-single-below-table". However an error '"fo:table-cell" is missing child elements. Required content model: marker* (%block;)' appeared. Using a choose construct in "label-value-single-below-table" with an empty ruler in case when there was no label-value pair worked fine, but had the disadvantage of an empty line each time this situation occurred. Accordingly, a global test is made outside these new templates, using the general template "empty-table-cell-catcher".
  - add all parts except the two inline groups for process events
